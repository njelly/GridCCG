# GridCCG
A collectible card game played on a chess board. Made with Unity. Imagine a combination of Hearthstone and Fire Emblem. The goal is to destroy the opponent's tower.

# Units
Units have 4 stats: 
- ***Conquer*** is the area a unit controls (allowing the player to cast additional cards within that area) and also the area where it can attack other units.
- ***Power*** is how much damage a unit can do to another unit during an attack.
- ***Movement*** is how far the unit can move in a single turn.
- ***HP*** is how much damage a unit can take before being destroyed.

# Cards
Cards can spawn units or spells within the player's conquered range.
